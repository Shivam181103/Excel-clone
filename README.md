# Excel-clone

1. Here I implement Excel UI and some foundational features like:

a.  You can create or delete a file easily .
b.  Multi-file system is supported.
c.  You can change the colour ,font-size , font-family and many things on a data.
d.  Here I create two -way winding 
e.  You can download the file and uplaod also .

ANd some additional features which I implement is :

 If you make a formula on some cells and if formula is cyclic than it detects cycle and make a circle by diffrent type of colour than you can correct that formula easily.
 
 for example :: if you put formula like:
    c2=  A1 + A2 
    b2=  c2+ 10;
    c3=b2+30;
    b2=A1+ 40;
    
     than here is a cycle.
